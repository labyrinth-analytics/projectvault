# LoreDocs

> A searchable, organized knowledge base for your AI projects. Store documents, tag them, search across them, and inject context into any Claude conversation.

**By [Labyrinth Analytics Consulting](https://labyrinthanalyticsconsulting.com)**

---

## Quick Install

**Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) -- a fast Python package manager.**

```bash
# Install uv (one time, if you don't have it)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Option A: Install from the Labyrinth Analytics marketplace

```bash
# 1. Add the marketplace (one time)
/plugin marketplace add labyrinth-analytics/claude-plugins

# 2. Install the plugin
/plugin install loredocs@labyrinth-analytics-claude-plugins

# 3. Enable the MCP server
/install loredocs
```

### Option B: Add directly as an MCP server

Add to your Claude Code settings (`.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "loredocs": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["loredocs"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Post-Install Setup

After installing, complete these steps to get the most out of LoreDocs:

### 1. Add CLAUDE.md instructions

Add the following to your project's `CLAUDE.md` or global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
## LoreDocs Knowledge Base

At the start of every session, call `vault_list` then `vault_inject_summary` to load relevant project knowledge.
When you create or update significant documentation, call `vault_add_doc` to store it in the knowledge base.
```

This tells Claude to automatically load project knowledge at session start.

### 2. Mount the data directory (Cowork only)

If you use **Cowork**, mount your LoreDocs data directory so Cowork sessions can access the database:

- Mount `~/.loredocs` as a folder in your Cowork project

Without this step, Cowork sessions cannot read or write to your knowledge vaults.

---

## The Problem

AI projects accumulate knowledge fast -- architecture decisions, API specs, configuration guides, meeting notes, runbooks. That knowledge lives in scattered files, chat histories, and people's heads. When you start a new Claude session, you're starting from scratch.

LoreDocs gives your AI projects a persistent, searchable brain.

## How It Works

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Your Documents\nspecs, configs, guides\nnotes, runbooks] -->|vault_add_doc| B[(LoreDocs DB\n~/.loredocs/\nloredocs.db)]

    B -->|vault_search| C[Search Results\nwith relevance ranking]
    B -->|vault_inject_summary| D[Claude Context\ninjects relevant docs\nat session start]
    B -->|vault_export_manifest| E[Manifest Export\nshare or version\nyour vault]

    F[Claude Code / Cowork] -->|MCP tools| B
```

**Add once, use everywhere.** Store a document in the vault and it's searchable from any Claude session -- Code, Cowork, or Chat (via export).

**Inject on demand.** Ask Claude to inject the vault summary at the start of a session and it automatically loads the most relevant context for the conversation you're about to have.

**Organize by project.** Group documents into named vaults (one per project), tag them, link related docs, and version-track changes over time.

## What You Can Store

LoreDocs handles text extraction from all common document types:

- Markdown and plain text (`.md`, `.txt`)
- Word documents (`.docx`)
- PDFs
- Excel spreadsheets (`.xlsx`)
- PowerPoint presentations (`.pptx`)
- Code files and configs
