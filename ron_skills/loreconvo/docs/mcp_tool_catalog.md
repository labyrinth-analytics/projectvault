# LoreConvo MCP Tool Catalog

LoreConvo provides 13 MCP tools that Claude calls during your sessions. You do not need to call these directly -- Claude uses them automatically when you ask it to save, search, or recall session context.

This catalog explains what each tool does, when Claude uses it, and what parameters it accepts.

## Session Memory

### `save_session`

Save a session summary to persistent memory. Claude calls this at the end of a session (or when you ask it to save).

**When Claude uses it:** After a work session, when you say "save this session" or when the auto-save hook fires at session end.

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `title` | text | yes | Short descriptive title for the session |
| `surface` | text | yes | Where this session ran: `cowork`, `code`, or `chat` |

| `decisions` | list of text | no | Key decisions made during the session |
| `artifacts` | list of text | no | Files created or modified |

**Returns:** The new session ID and a confirmation.

**Example conversation:**
> You: "Save this session to LoreConvo. We worked on the K-1 parser and decided to use decimal types."

**Free tier note:** Free accounts are limited to 50 saved sessions. After that, you will see a "limit_reached" message with a link to upgrade.
