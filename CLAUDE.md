## Debbie TODOs (only Debbie can do these)

1. [ ] File USPTO trademark for LoreConvo (Class 009, $350)
2. [ ] File USPTO trademark for LoreDocs (Class 009, $350)
3. [x] Register copyright with new names (LoreConvo, LoreDocs)
4. [ ] Review and approve rebuilt .plugin files when Ron completes them
5. [ ] Activate live Stripe account (business verification, bank account for payouts, EIN for Labyrinth Analytics). Sandbox already set up 2026-03-22. Needed before self-hosted GitHub marketplace can collect payments.

## Ron TODOs (autonomous work, priority order)

### Rebrand Finishing (Lore Product Family)
1. [x] Add migration script for existing users (move DB files from old paths to new) -- done 2026-03-27, scripts/migrate_lore.py
2. [x] Update revenue projection Excel with new names -- done 2026-03-27, docs/LoreConvo_Revenue_Projection.xlsx
3. [ ] Update BSL 1.1 license files with new product names (NOTE: no BSL files found in repo -- both products use MIT in pyproject.toml. Debbie to decide if BSL is still the plan)
4. [x] Rebuild .plugin files (loreconvo-v0.3.0.plugin, loredocs-v0.1.0.plugin) -- done 2026-03-27, both now use Lore names internally

### Infrastructure
5. [ ] Fix side_hustle venv isolation (may be running under conda base instead of project .venv)
6. [ ] Pin all dependencies: `pip freeze > requirements-lock.txt` for each product
7. [ ] Run `pip-audit` across all product venvs and resolve any findings

### LoreConvo CLI Fixes
8. [x] Add `loreconvo-cli` entry point to pyproject.toml pointing at `src/cli.py` -- done 2026-03-28
9. [x] In `hooks/scripts/auto_save.py`, detect `Skill` tool invocations -- already implemented (lines 70-78 correctly extract skill name from input.skill). Marked done 2026-03-28.
10. [x] Add `python cli.py skills list` subcommand -- done 2026-03-28 (also added list_all_skills() to database.py)

### Pipeline Improvements
11. [x] Add `set_hold_reason(opp_id, reason)` method to PipelineDB -- done 2026-03-28
12. [x] Fix LoreConvo README: `export` CLI flags verified correct -- CLI does support --last and --format. No fix needed. Confirmed 2026-03-29.
13. [x] Fix LoreDocs INSTALL.md: marked Options A and B as "coming soon" -- done 2026-03-28

### Security Fixes (SQL Query Optimizer API) — added 2026-03-29
14. [ ] CRITICAL: Revoke exposed Anthropic API key in `ron_skills/sql_query_optimizer/api/.env` and regenerate. NOTE: .env is gitignored and NOT in git history -- key is on-disk only. Still must revoke at console.anthropic.com.
15. [x] HIGH: Fix wildcard CORS in `ron_skills/sql_query_optimizer/api/main.py` -- done 2026-03-29 (env-var-driven origin list, allow_credentials=False, restricted methods/headers).
16. [x] HIGH: Pin exact dependency versions in `ron_skills/sql_query_optimizer/api/requirements.txt` -- done 2026-03-29, added slowapi==0.1.9.
17. [x] HIGH: Add rate limiting to `/admin/generate-key` endpoint -- done 2026-03-29 (SlowAPI 5/minute, IP logging).
18. [x] MEDIUM: Add `max_length` to SQL query input field in `OptimizeRequest` model -- done 2026-03-29 (max_length=50000).
19. [x] MEDIUM: Add security headers middleware -- done 2026-03-29 (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, CSP, Referrer-Policy, Cache-Control).

### New Products
20. [ ] SQL Query Optimizer: ClawHub skill packaging
21. [ ] SQL Query Optimizer: integration tests with real SQL Server queries
22. [ ] Build Financial Report Generator skill + FastMCP backend
23. [ ] Build CSV/Excel Data Transformer skill + FastMCP backend

## Product Research Scout (Scheduled Task)
- **Task:** `weekly-product-scout` — runs every Monday at 7 AM
- **Purpose:** Scans all AI platforms and developer ecosystems for niche product opportunities (picks and shovels)
- **Output:** HTML report + markdown summary saved to `~/Documents/Claude/Projects/Side Hustle/Opportunities/`
- **Scope:** All AI platforms (Claude, OpenAI, Cursor, Copilot, LangChain, etc.), developer forums, GitHub trending
- **Criteria:** Lightweight builds (weekend project or one-week sprint), monetizable, complements Lore ecosystem
- **Review:** Debbie reviews weekly report and picks winners for Ron to build

## Critical Rules
- NEVER publish, deploy, or make anything public without Debbie's explicit approval.
- ALWAYS use ASCII-only characters in Python source files (no Unicode checkmarks, box-drawing, smart quotes).
- ALWAYS check LoreConvo for recent sessions before starting work: call `get_recent_sessions` to see what was done last.
- ALWAYS check LoreDocs for current docs: call `vault_list` then `vault_inject_summary` for relevant vaults.
- ALWAYS commit your work to git with clear commit messages before ending a session.
- ALWAYS push to origin after committing: `git push origin master`
- ALWAYS update this CLAUDE.md when you complete a TODO (move it to docs/COMPLETED.md with date/commit).
- ALWAYS follow the priority order in the Ron TODOs list. Work on #1 first unless it's blocked, then #2, etc.
- Use Python 3.10+ and SQLite for all products. No external database dependencies.
- Use FastMCP for MCP servers, Pydantic v2 for validation.
- Dataclasses require direct attribute access (asset.description), not .get() dict access.
- ALWAYS pin dependency versions in requirements.txt (e.g., `fastmcp==0.x.x`). Never use unpinned `pip install`.
- Run `pip-audit` after installing any new package. Flag any vulnerabilities before committing.
- **Doc-sync checklist (run after ANY feature work):**
  1. Count actual `@mcp.tool()` decorators in server.py -- this is the source of truth for tool counts.
  2. Verify the tool count matches in: README.md, INSTALL.md, plugin README, SKILL.md, marketplace listing, and product CLAUDE.md.
  3. Verify every tool name in the docs matches the actual function name in server.py (no aliases or old names).
  4. Verify version numbers match across: SKILL.md metadata, README.md, product CLAUDE.md, and marketplace listing.
  5. Verify pricing/tier info matches across: INSTALL.md, marketplace listing, and product CLAUDE.md.
  6. If any doc references a marketplace install command, confirm whether that marketplace is actually live. If not, mark the command as "coming soon" or remove it.
  7. If milestones were completed, features shipped, blockers resolved, or product status changed, update `~/Documents/Claude/Projects/Side Hustle/Project_Ron_Product_Roadmap.html` -- move timeline dots from future/current to active/current, update the "What Changed" changelog, and refresh the "Next 30 Days" section.

## Session Workflow

When starting a session:
1. LoreConvo auto-loads recent context via SessionStart hook (no manual step needed)
2. Check LoreDocs: `vault_list()` then `vault_inject_summary()` for active vaults
3. Read this file -- check Debbie TODOs for new approvals/decisions, then Ron TODOs for next work item
4. Read the relevant product CLAUDE.md for the product you will work on
5. Pick the highest-priority Ron TODO that isn't blocked
6. Work on it, commit when done

When ending a session:
1. Commit all changes with descriptive messages
2. The SessionEnd hook auto-saves to LoreConvo (no manual step needed)
3. Regenerate the pipeline dashboard: `python scripts/generate_pipeline_dashboard.py`
4. If milestones were completed or product status changed, update the product roadmap (see doc-sync checklist item 7)
5. If you created/updated significant docs, add them to LoreDocs too
6. Move completed TODOs to docs/COMPLETED.md with date and commit hash

## Architecture Principles
- Local-first: all data on user's machine, no cloud dependency for core features
- SQLite+FTS5 for search (no vector embeddings in v1)
- Plain files on disk where possible (easy backup, git-friendly)
- MCP tools for LLM interface, CLI for human interface
- stdio transport for both Code and Cowork compatibility
- Monorepo structure: all products in ron_skills/ under one repo, distributable as separate .plugin files

## Revenue Strategy
- Free tier gets users in the door (limited vaults/sessions)
- Pro tier unlocks unlimited usage via Stripe billing (LoreConvo $8/mo, LoreDocs $9/mo)
- Team/Business tier ($19-20/mo) adds cloud sync and collaboration
- Distribution: Self-hosted GitHub marketplace (labyrinth-analytics/claude-plugins) first, then official submission to claude-plugins-official
- All three products cross-sell each other
- Stripe sandbox account created (2026-03-22); LoreDocs tiers.py has TierEnforcer ready

## Known Issues / Gotchas
- $HOME does NOT expand in ~/.claude/settings.json -- always use absolute paths
- Conda cannot resolve the `mcp` package -- always use standard Python venv
- git push will fail from Cowork VM (no GitHub credentials) -- Debbie pushes from her Mac
- Cowork sessions leave .git/*.lock files -- clean with: find .git -name "*.lock" -delete
- LiteLLM supply chain attack (2026-03-24): versions 1.82.7/1.82.8 on PyPI were compromised. Neither project uses LiteLLM. Audited clean. Pin deps to prevent future exposure.
- Product-specific issues are in each product's CLAUDE.md.

## Debbie's Preferences
- Primarily uses SQL Server and Python
- Wants to review everything before it goes public
- Prefers concise responses without trailing summaries
- Keep file outputs in correct subdirectories, never at project root
