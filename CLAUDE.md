## Debbie TODOs (only Debbie can do these)

1. [ ] File USPTO trademark for LoreConvo (Class 009, $350)
2. [ ] File USPTO trademark for LoreDocs (Class 009, $350)
3. [x] Register copyright with new names (LoreConvo, LoreDocs)
4. [ ] Review and approve rebuilt .plugin files when Ron completes them
5. [ ] Activate live Stripe account (business verification, bank account for payouts, EIN for Labyrinth Analytics). Sandbox already set up 2026-03-22. Needed before self-hosted GitHub marketplace can collect payments.

## Ron TODOs (autonomous work, priority order)

### Rebrand Finishing (Lore Product Family)
1. [x] Add migration script for existing users (move DB files from old paths to new) -- done 2026-03-27, scripts/migrate_lore.py
2. [x] Update revenue projection Excel with new names -- done 2026-03-27, docs/LoreConvo_Revenue_Projection.xlsx
3. [x] Switch from MIT to BSL 1.1 -- done 2026-03-31. Created LICENSE files for LoreConvo and LoreDocs, updated pyproject.toml (both), README.md (LoreConvo), PUBLISHING.md (both), marketplace_listing.md (both), plugin.json (.claude-plugin and .plugin zips).
4. [x] Rebuild .plugin files (loreconvo-v0.3.0.plugin, loredocs-v0.1.0.plugin) -- done 2026-03-27, both now use Lore names internally

### Infrastructure (PRIORITY — do these before New Products)
5. [x] Create proper .venv for each product that is missing one -- done 2026-03-31. LoreDocs requirements.txt generated. SQL Optimizer needs .venv created on Mac (setup script at scripts/setup_venvs.sh).
6. [x] Pin all dependencies: requirements-lock.txt generated for LoreConvo and LoreDocs from venv metadata -- done 2026-03-31. Fixed CVE-2026-34073 (cryptography 46.0.5->46.0.6) and CVE-2026-4539 (Pygments 2.19.2->2.20.0).
7. [x] Run `pip-audit` across all product venvs -- done 2026-03-31. All 3 products pass (0 CVEs after version bumps).

### LoreConvo CLI Fixes
8. [x] Add `loreconvo-cli` entry point to pyproject.toml pointing at `src/cli.py` -- done 2026-03-28
9. [x] In `hooks/scripts/auto_save.py`, detect `Skill` tool invocations -- already implemented (lines 70-78 correctly extract skill name from input.skill). Marked done 2026-03-28.
10. [x] Add `python cli.py skills list` subcommand -- done 2026-03-28 (also added list_all_skills() to database.py)

### Pipeline Improvements
11. [x] Add `set_hold_reason(opp_id, reason)` method to PipelineDB -- done 2026-03-28
12. [x] Fix LoreConvo README: `export` CLI flags verified correct -- CLI does support --last and --format. No fix needed. Confirmed 2026-03-29.
13. [x] Fix LoreDocs INSTALL.md: marked Options A and B as "coming soon" -- done 2026-03-28

### Security Fixes (SQL Query Optimizer API) — added 2026-03-29
14. [x] RECLASSIFIED (was CRITICAL, now INFO): Anthropic API key in `ron_skills/sql_query_optimizer/api/.env` is in a gitignored file on a single-user local machine with no remote access and no evidence of compromise. Reclassified per updated security guidelines 2026-03-31. No action required.
15. [x] HIGH: Fix wildcard CORS in `ron_skills/sql_query_optimizer/api/main.py` -- done 2026-03-29 (env-var-driven origin list, allow_credentials=False, restricted methods/headers).
16. [x] HIGH: Pin exact dependency versions in `ron_skills/sql_query_optimizer/api/requirements.txt` -- done 2026-03-29, added slowapi==0.1.9.
17. [x] HIGH: Add rate limiting to `/admin/generate-key` endpoint -- done 2026-03-29 (SlowAPI 5/minute, IP logging).
18. [x] MEDIUM: Add `max_length` to SQL query input field in `OptimizeRequest` model -- done 2026-03-29 (max_length=50000).
19. [x] MEDIUM: Add security headers middleware -- done 2026-03-29 (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, CSP, Referrer-Policy, Cache-Control).

### Rebrand Cleanup
20. [x] Rename LoreDocs `docs/marketing/convovault_projectvault_diagram.html` and `convovault_projectvault_sketch.html` to use Lore branding (loreconvo_loredocs_*) -- done 2026-04-01

### Documentation
21. [x] Add README.md for LoreDocs (modeled after LoreConvo README: tagline, quick start, usage for Code/Cowork, tool list, license) -- done 2026-04-01

### Marketplace & Billing (PRIORITY -- revenue blocker)
22. [ ] Build self-hosted GitHub marketplace repo (labyrinth-analytics/claude-plugins) -- package plugins for distribution, create install instructions, integrate Stripe billing
23. [x] Sync Debbie's 2026-03-31 pipeline decisions to PipelineDB (OPP-002/003/004 approved, OPP-006/008 on hold, OPP-007/009/010 approved-for-review with priorities) -- done 2026-04-02

### Plugin Onboarding & Auto-Load Fixes (user experience -- do before marketplace launch)
24. [x] Fix LoreConvo SessionStart hook: wire up `auto_load.py` in plugin.json as second hook entry. Flattened nested hooks array structure. -- done 2026-04-02
25. [x] Add "Recommended CLAUDE.md Setup" section to LoreConvo README.md with exact snippet for ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md session start/end instructions, Code and Cowork guidance. -- done 2026-04-02
26. [x] Add "Recommended CLAUDE.md Setup" section to LoreDocs README.md (same pattern as LoreConvo). -- done 2026-04-02
27. [ ] Build `/lore-onboard` skill for LoreConvo plugin that walks users through first-time setup: verifies MCP server is connected, adds CLAUDE.md snippet, runs a test save/load cycle, confirms hooks are firing.
28. [x] Add "Verify Installation" section to both READMEs with a quick test: "Ask Claude to run `get_recent_sessions` / `vault_list` -- if you see results, it is working." -- done 2026-04-02
29. [x] Fix COWORK_RESTORE.md: rewrote with correct tool names, CLAUDE.md workaround as primary recommendation, manual restore as fallback. -- done 2026-04-02

### New Products
30. [ ] SQL Query Optimizer: ClawHub skill packaging
31. [ ] SQL Query Optimizer: integration tests with real SQL Server queries
32. [ ] Build Financial Report Generator skill + FastMCP backend
33. [ ] Build CSV/Excel Data Transformer skill + FastMCP backend

## Product Research Scout (Scheduled Task)
- **Task:** `weekly-product-scout` — runs every Monday at 3 AM
- **Purpose:** Scans all AI platforms and developer ecosystems for niche product opportunities (picks and shovels)
- **Output:** HTML report + markdown summary saved to `~/Documents/Claude/Projects/Side Hustle/Opportunities/`
- **Scope:** All AI platforms (Claude, OpenAI, Cursor, Copilot, LangChain, etc.), developer forums, GitHub trending
- **Criteria:** Lightweight builds (weekend project or one-week sprint), monetizable, complements Lore ecosystem
- **Review:** Debbie reviews weekly report and picks winners for Ron to build

## Agent Team

| Agent | Role | Task ID | Schedule | Reports To |
|-------|------|---------|----------|------------|
| Ron | Builder | `ron-daily` | Daily 12:00 AM | docs/COMPLETED.md, LoreConvo |
| Meg | QA Engineer | `meg-qa-daily` | Daily 2:00 AM | docs/qa/, LoreConvo |
| Brock | Cybersecurity Expert | `brock-security-daily` | Daily 3:00 AM | docs/security/, LoreConvo |
| Scout | Product Research | `weekly-product-scout` | Monday 3:00 AM | Opportunities/, LoreConvo |
| Gina | Enterprise Architect | `enterprise-architect-gina` | Wed + Sat 4:00 AM | LoreConvo (pipeline) |
| Jacqueline | Project Manager | `pm-jacqueline-daily` | Daily 4:30 AM | docs/pm/, LoreConvo |
| Madison | Content Marketer | `madison-marketing-agent` | Tue + Fri 1:00 AM | docs/marketing/, LoreConvo |

### Meg - QA Engineer (Scheduled Task)
- **Task:** `meg-qa-daily` -- runs daily at 2:00 AM (after Ron)
- **Purpose:** Full QA review of Ron's code: runs tests, writes new test cases, code walkthrough for logic errors, edge case analysis, verifies docs match behavior
- **Output:** Dated QA report in `docs/qa/qa_report_YYYY_MM_DD.md` + LoreConvo session (surface='qa')
- **Scope:** All products in ron_skills/ -- focuses on recently changed files
- **Severity ratings:** GREEN (all tests pass, no issues) / YELLOW (minor issues found) / RED (critical bugs found)
- **Rule:** Meg does NOT modify Ron's source code -- only adds test files and reports

### Brock - Cybersecurity Expert (Scheduled Task)
- **Task:** `brock-security-daily` -- runs daily at 3:00 AM (after Meg)
- **Purpose:** Full security posture review: secrets scanning, dependency audit (pip-audit + CVE check), OWASP code review, API security checks, security headers, infrastructure review
- **Output:** Dated security report in `docs/security/security_report_YYYY_MM_DD.md` + LoreConvo session (surface='security')
- **Scope:** Entire repo -- code, dependencies, configs, git history
- **Severity ratings:** SECURE / NEEDS ATTENTION / AT RISK
- **Rule:** Brock does NOT modify source code -- only writes reports and flags issues for Ron to fix

#### Brock Security Classification Guidelines
- **API keys in local .env files:** If a key is in a gitignored `.env` on Debbie's single-user Mac with no remote access, classify as **INFO** (not CRITICAL). Note it for awareness but do not flag as action-required or use alarm language ("!! CRITICAL - ACTION REQUIRED !!"). Only escalate to CRITICAL if the key is found in git history, a public repo, a shared system, or shows signs of compromise.
- **Dependency pinning:** Check for `requirements-lock.txt` files (not just `pyproject.toml`). It is normal and expected for `pyproject.toml` to use `>=` minimum version constraints -- that is library metadata. The `requirements-lock.txt` files contain the actual exact pins. If lock files exist with exact versions, the dependency pinning finding is RESOLVED.
- **Single-user context:** All products currently run locally on a single-user machine. Severity ratings should reflect this context. Findings that would be CRITICAL in a multi-user server deployment may be LOW or INFO in the current local-only setup.

### Jacqueline - Project Manager (Scheduled Task)
- **Task:** `pm-jacqueline-daily` -- runs daily at 4:30 AM (after Brock)
- **Purpose:** Synthesizes all overnight agent outputs into a single interactive HTML executive dashboard. Cross-validates agent findings, tracks pipeline status, monitors TODO progress, and flags items needing Debbie's attention.
- **Output:** Interactive HTML dashboard in `docs/pm/executive_dashboard_YYYY_MM_DD.html` + LoreConvo session (surface='pm')
- **Scope:** All agent reports (Ron/Meg/Brock), pipeline data (Scout/Gina), CLAUDE.md TODOs, cross-agent validation
- **Posture ratings:** ALL CLEAR / REVIEW NEEDED / ACTION REQUIRED
- **Rule:** Jacqueline does NOT modify source code, TODOs, or other agents' reports -- only produces the dashboard

### Madison - Marketing Content Creator (Scheduled Task)
- **Task:** `madison-marketing-agent` -- runs twice weekly at 1:00 AM (Tuesday, Friday)
- **Purpose:** Create blog post drafts, promotional copy, and marketing content for Labyrinth Analytics Consulting and the Lore product family. Promotes LoreConvo, LoreDocs, LorePrompts, and LoreScope through educational content, thought leadership, and product announcements.
- **Output:** Dated blog post drafts in `docs/marketing/blog_drafts/` + promo copy in `docs/marketing/promo/` + LoreConvo session (surface='marketing')
- **Scope:** Blog posts (800-2000 words) targeting data engineers and AI practitioners. Topics: data pipeline design, Claude plugins, AI productivity, Lore suite features.
- **Content Calendar:** Madison maintains a rolling 8-week content calendar in `docs/marketing/content_calendar_madison.md`
- **Rule:** Madison does NOT publish anything directly. All content goes to draft for Debbie's review before publishing.

## Approvals

| Product | Item | Status |
|---------|------|--------|
| LoreConvo | Marketplace listing | APPROVED |
| LoreConvo | Revenue projection Excel | APPROVED |
| LoreDocs | Cowork plugin packaging | APPROVED |
| LoreDocs | Marketplace listing | APPROVED |

## Critical Rules — Public Repo Hygiene (MANDATORY)
The LoreConvo and LoreDocs repos are PUBLIC on GitHub. Internal business documents MUST NEVER be committed to files tracked by these repos. Before creating or modifying any file inside `ron_skills/loreconvo/` or `ron_skills/loredocs/`, check whether it belongs in the public repo or is internal-only.

**NEVER commit these to public-facing product directories:**
- Revenue projections, financial models, MRR targets (*.xlsx with revenue data, build_revenue_projection.py)
- Product requirement documents (PRDs), product specs with competitive analysis or pricing strategy
- PUBLISHING.md, marketplace_listing.md (go-to-market strategy, submission plans)
- CLAUDE.md files inside product directories (contain revenue targets, internal agent instructions)
- Any document containing: pricing numbers, MRR/ARR targets, competitive intelligence, Stripe keys, or customer data

**WHERE internal docs go instead:**
- Revenue projections, PRDs, publishing plans: `docs/internal/loreconvo/` or `docs/internal/loredocs/` (private monorepo, never subtree-pushed)
- Product CLAUDE.md files: stay in product directories but are in each product's `.gitignore` (local agent instructions, not user docs)
- If you need to create a new internal doc, put it in `docs/internal/<product>/` — NEVER in the product directory itself

**What IS safe for public repos:**
- README.md, INSTALL.md, LICENSE (user-facing documentation)
- Source code (src/, tests/)
- pyproject.toml, requirements.txt, requirements-lock.txt
- Skills, hooks, config files (.mcp.json with no secrets)
- COWORK_RESTORE.md, INSTALL_HOOK.md (user setup docs)

**Pre-push checklist (run before ANY subtree push to loreconvo or loredocs remotes):**
1. `git diff --cached --name-only` -- review every file being committed
2. Verify NO files from the "NEVER commit" list above are included
3. Check that the product's `.gitignore` is up to date
4. If in doubt, ask Debbie before pushing

## Pipeline Integration (MANDATORY for ALL agents)

**Every agent MUST use PipelineDB for their pipeline interactions.** Read `docs/PIPELINE_AGENT_GUIDE.md` for your role-specific instructions. The pipeline is the shared data layer connecting all agents -- if you do not use it, downstream agents cannot see your work.

Key responsibilities:
- **Ron:** Sync Debbie's decisions from DEBBIE_DASHBOARD.md to PipelineDB at the START of every session (before other work). Update status to 'in-progress' when building, 'completed' when done.
- **Scout:** Create `db.add_opportunity()` entries for every opportunity discovered.
- **Gina:** Query `db.get_by_status('approved-for-review')` and write architecture via `db.set_architecture()`.
- **Meg:** Log QA findings to pipeline items via `db.set_open_questions()`.
- **Brock:** Log security findings to pipeline items via `db.set_open_questions()`. Use `db.set_hold_reason()` for CRITICAL findings.
- **Jacqueline:** Query `db.get_all_pipeline()` as the primary data source for the executive dashboard.
- **Madison:** Check pipeline for product status before writing about any product.

## Other Critical Rules
- NEVER publish, deploy, or make anything public without Debbie's explicit approval.
- ALWAYS use ASCII-only characters in Python source files (no Unicode checkmarks, box-drawing, smart quotes).
- ALWAYS check LoreConvo for recent sessions before starting work: call `get_recent_sessions` MCP tool, or fallback: `python scripts/save_to_loreconvo.py --read --limit 5`.
- ALWAYS check LoreDocs for current docs: call `vault_list` then `vault_inject_summary` for relevant vaults. **Fallback (if MCP tools unavailable):** `python scripts/query_loredocs.py --list` and `python scripts/query_loredocs.py --info "vault name"`.
- ALWAYS commit your work to git with clear commit messages before ending a session.
- ALWAYS push to origin after committing: `git push origin master`
- ALWAYS save sessions to LoreConvo at session end. Preferred: `save_session` MCP tool. **Fallback (if MCP tools unavailable):** run `python scripts/save_to_loreconvo.py --title "..." --surface "..." --summary "..."` -- this script auto-generates UUIDs and matches the MCP tool's behavior exactly. NEVER use raw SQL INSERT.
- ALWAYS update this CLAUDE.md when you complete a TODO (move it to docs/COMPLETED.md with date/commit).
- ALWAYS check `docs/qa/` and `docs/security/` for recent Meg/Brock reports at session start. Fix CRITICAL/HIGH findings before regular TODOs.
- ALWAYS follow the priority order in the Ron TODOs list. Work on #1 first unless it's blocked, then #2, etc.
- Use Python 3.10+ and SQLite for all products. No external database dependencies.
- Use FastMCP for MCP servers, Pydantic v2 for validation.
- Dataclasses require direct attribute access (asset.description), not .get() dict access.
- ALWAYS pin dependency versions in requirements.txt (e.g., `fastmcp==0.x.x`). Never use unpinned `pip install`.
- Run `pip-audit` after installing any new package. Flag any vulnerabilities before committing.
- **Doc-sync checklist (run after ANY feature work):**
  1. Count actual `@mcp.tool()` decorators in server.py -- this is the source of truth for tool counts.
  2. Verify the tool count matches in: README.md, INSTALL.md, plugin README, SKILL.md, marketplace listing, and product CLAUDE.md.
  3. Verify every tool name in the docs matches the actual function name in server.py (no aliases or old names).
  4. Verify version numbers match across: SKILL.md metadata, README.md, product CLAUDE.md, and marketplace listing.
  5. Verify pricing/tier info matches across: INSTALL.md, marketplace listing, and product CLAUDE.md.
  6. If any doc references a marketplace install command, confirm whether that marketplace is actually live. If not, mark the command as "coming soon" or remove it.
  7. If milestones were completed, features shipped, blockers resolved, or product status changed, update `~/Documents/Claude/Projects/Side Hustle/Project_Ron_Product_Roadmap.html` -- move timeline dots from future/current to active/current, update the "What Changed" changelog, and refresh the "Next 30 Days" section.

## Session Workflow

When starting a session:
1. **Load recent LoreConvo context:** Try `get_recent_sessions` MCP tool first. If MCP tools are not available, use the fallback: `python scripts/save_to_loreconvo.py --read --limit 5` (or `--search "keyword"` for targeted lookups).
2. Check LoreDocs: try `vault_list()` then `vault_inject_summary()` MCP tools. Fallback: `python scripts/query_loredocs.py --list` and `python scripts/query_loredocs.py --info "vault name"`
3. Read this file -- check Debbie TODOs for new approvals/decisions, then Ron TODOs for next work item
4. **Sync pipeline (Ron only):** Read DEBBIE_DASHBOARD.md for any new decisions. Apply status changes to PipelineDB using `update_status()`, `set_priority()`, `set_hold_reason()`. See `docs/PIPELINE_AGENT_GUIDE.md` for details.
5. **Check for Meg/Brock findings:** Read the latest reports in `docs/qa/` and `docs/security/`. Also search LoreConvo: try `search_sessions("agent:meg")` MCP tool, or fallback: `python scripts/save_to_loreconvo.py --search "agent:meg"`. CRITICAL and HIGH severity bugs or vulnerabilities take priority over regular TODOs -- fix them first.
6. Read the relevant product CLAUDE.md for the product you will work on
7. Read `docs/PIPELINE_AGENT_GUIDE.md` for your agent's pipeline responsibilities
8. Pick the highest-priority work: Meg/Brock CRITICAL/HIGH fixes first, then Ron TODOs in order
9. Work on it, commit when done

When ending a session:
1. Commit all changes with descriptive messages
2. **Save to LoreConvo (MANDATORY):** Try `save_session` MCP tool first. If MCP tools are not available (common in scheduled Cowork tasks), use the direct fallback script instead:
   ```
   python scripts/save_to_loreconvo.py \
       --title "Agent-name session YYYY-MM-DD" \
       --surface "your-surface" \
       --summary "What was accomplished..." \
       --tags '["agent:your-name", "other-tag"]' \
       --artifacts '["path/to/file1.md", "path/to/file2.md"]'
   ```
   Valid surfaces: cowork, code, chat, qa, security, pm, marketing, pipeline
3. Regenerate the pipeline dashboard: `python scripts/generate_pipeline_dashboard.py`
4. If milestones were completed or product status changed, update the product roadmap (see doc-sync checklist item 7)
5. If you created/updated significant docs, add them to LoreDocs: try `vault_add_document` MCP tool, or fallback: `python scripts/query_loredocs.py --add-doc --vault "vault name" --name "doc name" --file path/to/file.md`
6. Move completed TODOs to docs/COMPLETED.md with date and commit hash

## Architecture Principles
- Local-first: all data on user's machine, no cloud dependency for core features
- SQLite+FTS5 for search (no vector embeddings in v1)
- Plain files on disk where possible (easy backup, git-friendly)
- MCP tools for LLM interface, CLI for human interface
- stdio transport for both Code and Cowork compatibility
- Monorepo structure: all products in ron_skills/ under one repo, distributable as separate .plugin files

## Revenue Strategy
- Free tier gets users in the door (limited vaults/sessions)
- Pro tier unlocks unlimited usage via Stripe billing (LoreConvo $8/mo, LoreDocs $9/mo)
- Team/Business tier ($19-20/mo) adds cloud sync and collaboration
- Distribution: Self-hosted GitHub marketplace (labyrinth-analytics/claude-plugins) first, then official submission to claude-plugins-official
- All three products cross-sell each other
- Stripe sandbox account created (2026-03-22); LoreDocs tiers.py has TierEnforcer ready

## Known Issues / Gotchas
- $HOME does NOT expand in ~/.claude/settings.json -- always use absolute paths
- Conda cannot resolve the `mcp` package -- always use standard Python venv
- git push will fail from Cowork VM (no GitHub credentials) -- Debbie pushes from her Mac
- Cowork sessions leave .git/*.lock files -- clean with: find .git -name "*.lock" -delete
- LiteLLM supply chain attack (2026-03-24): versions 1.82.7/1.82.8 on PyPI were compromised. Neither project uses LiteLLM. Audited clean. Pin deps to prevent future exposure.
- Product-specific issues are in each product's CLAUDE.md.

## Debbie's Preferences
- Primarily uses SQL Server and Python
- Wants to review everything before it goes public
- Prefers concise responses without trailing summaries
- Keep file outputs in correct subdirectories, never at project root
