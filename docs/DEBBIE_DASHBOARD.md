# Debbie's Action Dashboard

Single source of truth for everything that needs Debbie's attention.
Updated by Jacqueline (daily) or manually. Last updated: 2026-04-05 (manual update: license key saved, marketplace email confirmed).

## TODAY -- 2026-04-05 (Sunday)

### Major Progress: License Key System Complete

Ron completed the Ed25519 offline-verifiable license key system for both products on Apr 3.
The Pro tier is now properly secured -- external users cannot unlock Pro by setting env vars alone.
The /lore-onboard guided setup skill was also shipped. MEG-037 is RESOLVED.

**Overnight summary:**
- Ron: 9 commits (license key system, /lore-onboard skill, MEG-037 fix, SEC-012/013 fixes)
- Meg (Apr 4): YELLOW -- 338 tests pass (+34). 3 new advisory findings (MEG-038/039/040), all LOW/ADVISORY (see `docs/internal/qa/`)
- Brock: No Apr 4 report (last: Apr 3 Run B, NEEDS ATTENTION -- SEC-014 and SEC-015 are new)
- Scout: 5 new opportunities (OPP-017 to OPP-021) -- AI observability and data quality theme
- Gina: RAN -- 3 architecture proposals (OPP-013, OPP-015, OPP-016) + product review (2 MEDIUM findings)
- John: FIRST RUN -- baseline documentation created for LoreConvo and LoreDocs
- Madison: Friday promo email drafted (companion to Blog #1)

**NOTE:** Agent reports now live in `docs/internal/` subdirectories (qa/, security/, architecture/, pm/, marketing/, technical/). Public-facing product docs remain in product directories.

### DONE: License Key System Complete (2026-04-05)

Debbie has generated Pro license keys for both LoreConvo and LoreDocs and saved the private signing key to her password vault. Environment variables updated. This item is closed.

## Decisions Made

### 1. DECIDED: BSL 1.1 licensing for Lore products (2026-03-31)

**Decision:** Switch from MIT to BSL 1.1. Parameters confirmed by Debbie:
- **Change Date:** 4 years (each version converts to open source 4 years after release)
- **Change License:** Apache 2.0
- **Additional Use Grant:** LoreConvo: free for individual non-commercial use with up to 50 sessions. LoreDocs: free for individual non-commercial use with up to 3 vaults.

**Status:** COMPLETED by Ron on 2026-03-31. LICENSE files created, pyproject.toml updated, all doc references updated, plugins rebuilt.

### 2. DECIDED: Self-hosted GitHub marketplace (2026-03-31)

**Decision:** Proceed with self-hosted GitHub marketplace (labyrinth-analytics/claude-plugins).
The official Claude marketplace has "knowledge-work-plugins" reserved by Anthropic, so
self-hosted is the path forward. Can submit to the official marketplace later if it opens up.

**Status:** COMPLETED by Ron on 2026-04-03. Marketplace structure built locally (marketplace/claude-plugins/). Debbie needs to create the GitHub repo and push.

### 3. DECIDED: Pipeline opportunity dispositions (2026-03-31)

**Scout opportunities:**
- OPP-006: SSIS Packager Analyzer -- ON HOLD (no local SQL Server)
- OPP-007: Data Pipeline Test Harness MCP -- APPROVED for architectural review, P2
- OPP-008: Schema Diff & Migration MCP -- ON HOLD (no local SQL Server)

- Agent Communication Protocol added to CLAUDE.md (structured LoreConvo sessions)
- Business email for marketplace: info@labyrinthanalyticsconsulting.com (not Gmail)

### 8. DECIDED: Test files should NOT be in public repos (2026-04-04)

Meg's test scripts are being tracked in git and would be included in subtree pushes to public repos. Add tests/ to public repo .gitignore or exclude from subtree pushes. Ron to fix before next subtree push.

| OPP | Name | Effort | Est. MRR M12 | Scout Notes |
|-----|------|--------|--------------|-------------|
| OPP-017 | LoreEval (AI Agent Test Runner) | 3 | ~$900 | pytest-style LLM eval CLI |
| OPP-018 | LangGraph Workflow Inspector | 5 | ~$700 | Debug LangGraph state machines |
| OPP-019 | FinNorm (Brokerage CSV Normalizer) | 3 | ~$600 | Schwab/YNAB/Buildium normalizer |
| OPP-020 | LoreCheck (Data Quality CLI) | 5 | ~$1,200 | Great Expectations alternative |
| OPP-021 | Chain Lens (Prompt Chain Observability) | 5 | ~$800 | Observe multi-step LLM chains |

#### Create GitHub repo + push marketplace
- `marketplace.json` owner.email confirmed correct: info@labyrinthanalyticsconsulting.com (SEC-015 RESOLVED)
- Create `labyrinth-analytics/claude-plugins` on GitHub
- Push `marketplace/` directory contents
- Test: `/plugin marketplace add labyrinth-analytics/claude-plugins`
  followed by: `/plugin install loreconvo@labyrinth-analytics-claude-plugins`
  then: `/install loreconvo`
Where tracked: `CLAUDE.md` Debbie TODO #6

### MEDIUM PRIORITY

#### Review rebuilt .plugin files (ready -- all fixes applied)
Ron fixed all install flow issues on Apr 3:
- Both .mcp.json files now ship with empty PRO defaults (MEG-037 RESOLVED)
- READMEs have full install flow docs (marketplace add, /install step, CLAUDE.md snippet, Cowork mount)
- Both plugin.json files updated (homepage/repository fields, LoreDocs license fixed to BSL-1.1)
- Both .plugin zips rebuilt
Where tracked: `CLAUDE.md` Debbie TODO #3

#### Activate live Stripe account
- Sandbox already set up (2026-03-22). LoreDocs `tiers.py` has TierEnforcer ready.
- Credit union account still pending (technical issue as of 4/2)
- What's needed: business verification, bank account for payouts, EIN for Labyrinth Analytics
Where tracked: `CLAUDE.md` Debbie TODO #5

#### Publish Madison blog post #2
- "Building a Reference Library for AI Projects: How LoreDocs Vault Architecture Works"
- File: `docs/internal/marketing/blog_drafts/blog_loredocs_vault_architecture_2026_04_03.md`
- Blog #1 published successfully on Apr 2

### ON HOLD

#### File USPTO trademarks for LoreConvo & LoreDocs
- ON HOLD per Debbie 2026-04-02: wait until products gain traction (repo views, users, revenue)
- Class 009, estimated $350 each. Names are TESS-clean and Google-clean.
Where tracked: `CLAUDE.md` Debbie TODOs #1 and #2

---

## Ron Action Items (CURRENT)

### TOP PRIORITY for next Ron session

1. **Fix SEC-014:** Add `cryptography>=42.0.0` to [project.dependencies] in both
   `ron_skills/loreconvo/pyproject.toml` and `ron_skills/loredocs/pyproject.toml`.
   Without this, Pro license validation fails with ModuleNotFoundError on fresh installs.

2. **Clean stale git locks (first):** `find .git -name "*.lock" -mmin +30 -delete`
   Then commit untracked files:
   - `scripts/generate_license_key.py`
   - `scripts/test_generate_license_key.py`
   - `docs/internal/security/security_report_2026_04_03_b.md`

3. **LoreConvo CLI entry point (TODO #1):** Add `ron_skills/loreconvo/src/cli/` with
   save-session, list-sessions, search commands. Migrate logic from scripts/save_to_loreconvo.py.

4. **Fix GINA-001 (MEDIUM):** Fix `vault_set_tier` bypass in LoreDocs -- get_tier() reads config.json fallback before license check. Must be fixed before marketplace publish.

5. **Fix GINA-002 (MEDIUM):** Rebuild LoreConvo .plugin bundle to include the `/lore-onboard` skill. Users installing from marketplace won't get the onboarding command without this fix.

6. **Fix MEG-038 (LOW):** Remove unused import (Encoding, PublicFormat) in `ron_skills/loreconvo/src/core/license.py`.

### AFTER CLI ENTRY POINTS

5. LoreDocs CLI entry point (TODO #2)
6. Slim down agent prompts to reference product CLIs (TODO #3)
7. Update monorepo scripts to be thin wrappers (TODO #4)
8. Update CLAUDE.md agent paths (TODO #5, cleanup)

## Reviews Waiting (Agent Reports)

### Gina Architecture -- 2026-04-04 (RAN -- 3 proposals)
Architecture proposals for all 3 waiting items. Full proposals in `docs/internal/architecture/`.

**OPP-015 (Data Catalog Lite, P1):** HIGH COMPATIBILITY with Lore architecture. Reuses TierEnforcer pattern. $10/mo Pro. Gina recommends APPROVE.

**OPP-013 (Data Pipeline Test Harness, P2):** MODERATE COMPATIBILITY. New pattern (dual-DB connections). $15/mo Pro. Review carefully before approving.

**OPP-016 (ETL Pattern Library, P3):** Gina recommends scope RETHINK -- SQL-Server-only is too narrow. Reframe to two-dialect (T-SQL + Python) or pure Python. Needs your decision on scope before she can approve.

**Product review findings (2 MEDIUM):**
- **GINA-001 (MEDIUM):** LoreDocs `vault_set_tier('pro')` via MCP bypasses license validation. Ron must fix before publish.
- **GINA-002 (MEDIUM):** `/lore-onboard` skill not packaged in .plugin bundle. Ron must rebuild .plugin zip.

Full report: `docs/internal/architecture/product_review_2026_04_04.md`

### John Tech Docs -- 2026-04-04 (FIRST RUN)

- Full report: `docs/internal/qa/qa_report_2026_04_04.md`

### Brock Security -- 2026-04-03 Run B (NEEDS ATTENTION)
- **SEC-014 (MEDIUM, NEW):** cryptography missing from pyproject.toml in both products. Blocks Pro tier for fresh installs. Ron to fix next session.
- **SEC-015 (LOW, NEW):** Personal Gmail in marketplace.json owner.email. Debbie must update before creating public GitHub repo.
- **SEC-012 (RESOLVED):** anthropic bumped to 0.87.0
- **SEC-013 (RESOLVED):** SQL Optimizer .gitignore created
