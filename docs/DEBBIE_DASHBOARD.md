## TODAY -- 2026-04-07 (Tuesday)

### STABILITY MANDATE: IN PROGRESS -- Feature Freeze STILL IN EFFECT

CLAUDE.md has 2 open TODOs for the Stability Mandate:
1. Fix plugin install flow end-to-end -- install.sh fixed by Ron (Apr 6) but Cowork end-to-end NOT yet confirmed by Debbie.
2. Fix fallback script DB discovery -- _find_loreconvo_db() must check mounted paths before VM home (one-line reorder in save_to_loreconvo.py). NOT yet done.

Nothing ships until BOTH are complete AND Debbie confirms Cowork MCP tools are callable and sessions persist.

CORRECTION NOTE: Yesterday's dashboard (Apr 6) incorrectly stated the Stability Mandate was complete and the feature freeze was lifted. That was an error corrected by Debbie (LoreConvo session 2026-04-06 agent:debbie). The mandate remains open per CLAUDE.md.

**Overnight summary (agents for Apr 6-7):**
- Ron: Ran Apr 6, 9:25 PM. Fixed GINA-003 (LoreDocs license.py env_value guard), partial MEG-050 fix, added LoreDocs INSTALL.md.
- Meg: Ran Apr 6 (2 runs). GREEN individual suites (359 tests pass). MEG-050/052 combined pytest collision remains open -- run suites separately.
- Brock: Ran Apr 7 00:39. NEEDS ATTENTION (stable). 0 CVEs. GINA-003 security-verified.
- Competitive Intel: Ran Apr 6. ALERT: Claude-Mem (21.5k stars in 3 weeks) is a direct LoreConvo competitor at HIGH threat level.
- Gina: Product review Apr 6 filed. Architecture proposals OPP-013/015/016 await your review.
- Madison: Ran Apr 7 00:40. Fixed blog #2 (all 3 fixes applied, ready for review). Created blog #3 draft.
- Jacqueline: Running now (Apr 7 1:38 AM)

### IMMEDIATE ACTION: Apply 8 Pending Commits

8 agent commits are stuck in pending_commits.json (git push blocked from Cowork VM).
Run from your Mac: `python scripts/safe_git.py apply`

## Decisions Made

### 1. DECIDED: BSL 1.1 licensing for Lore products (2026-03-31)

**Decision:** Switch from MIT to BSL 1.1. Parameters confirmed by Debbie:
- **Change Date:** 4 years (each version converts to open source 4 years after release)
- **Change License:** Apache 2.0
- **Additional Use Grant:** LoreConvo: free for individual non-commercial use with up to 50 sessions. LoreDocs: free for individual non-commercial use with up to 3 vaults.

**Status:** COMPLETED by Ron on 2026-03-31. LICENSE files created, pyproject.toml updated, all doc references updated, plugins rebuilt.

### 2. DECIDED: Self-hosted GitHub marketplace (2026-03-31)

**Decision:** Proceed with self-hosted GitHub marketplace (labyrinth-analytics/claude-plugins).
The official Claude marketplace has "knowledge-work-plugins" reserved by Anthropic, so
self-hosted is the path forward. Can submit to the official marketplace later if it opens up.

**Status:** COMPLETED by Ron on 2026-04-03. Marketplace structure built locally (marketplace/claude-plugins/). Debbie needs to create the GitHub repo and push.

### 3. DECIDED: Pipeline opportunity dispositions (2026-03-31)

**Scout opportunities:**
- OPP-006: SSIS Packager Analyzer -- ON HOLD (no local SQL Server)

- Agent Communication Protocol added to CLAUDE.md (structured LoreConvo sessions)
- Business email for marketplace: info@labyrinthanalyticsconsulting.com (not Gmail)

### 8. DECIDED: Test files should NOT be in public repos (2026-04-04)

Meg's test scripts are being tracked in git and would be included in subtree pushes to public repos. Add tests/ to public repo .gitignore or exclude from subtree pushes. Ron to fix before next subtree push.

## Things Only Debbie Can Do

### TOP PRIORITY

#### [NEW] Apply 7 pending git commits
Run from your Mac: `python scripts/safe_git.py apply`
Includes Ron's MEG-043/044/045 fixes, Gina Apr 5 review, Jacqueline dashboards.

#### Investigate 3 Silent Agents (Ron, Meg, Brock)
These agents show no LoreConvo sessions for April 6. Verify the scheduled task prompts
received the cd path fix from your April 5 session (you fixed 11 agent prompt .md files --
confirm the 12 Cowork task definitions also use the correct working directory path).

#### Triage 2 remaining Scout opportunities (OPP-017, OPP-018)
OPP-019 (FinNorm), OPP-020 (LoreCheck), OPP-021 (Chain Lens) already pre-approved.
Still need your decision on:

#### Triage 5 new Scout opportunities (OPP-017 to OPP-021)
Scout surfaced these on Friday Apr 3. Decide: Approve / Needs Info / Defer / Reject for each.

| OPP | Name | Effort | Est. MRR M12 | Scout Notes |
|-----|------|--------|--------------|-------------|
| OPP-017 | LoreEval (AI Agent Test Runner) | 3 | ~$900 | pytest-style LLM eval CLI |
| OPP-018 | LangGraph Workflow Inspector | 5 | ~$700 | Debug LangGraph state machines |
| OPP-019 | FinNorm (Brokerage CSV Normalizer) | 3 | ~$600 | Schwab/YNAB/Buildium normalizer |
| OPP-020 | LoreCheck (Data Quality CLI) | 5 | ~$1,200 | Great Expectations alternative |
| OPP-021 | Chain Lens (Prompt Chain Observability) | 5 | ~$800 | Observe multi-step LLM chains |

#### Create GitHub repo + push marketplace
- `marketplace.json` owner.email confirmed correct: info@labyrinthanalyticsconsulting.com (SEC-015 RESOLVED)
- Create `labyrinth-analytics/claude-plugins` on GitHub
- Push `marketplace/` directory contents
- Test: `/plugin marketplace add labyrinth-analytics/claude-plugins`
  followed by: `/plugin install loreconvo@labyrinth-analytics-claude-plugins`
  then: `/install loreconvo`
Where tracked: `CLAUDE.md` Debbie TODO #6

### MEDIUM PRIORITY

#### Review rebuilt .plugin files (ready -- all fixes applied)
Ron fixed all install flow issues on Apr 3:
- Both .mcp.json files now ship with empty PRO defaults (MEG-037 RESOLVED)
- READMEs have full install flow docs (marketplace add, /install step, CLAUDE.md snippet, Cowork mount)
- Both plugin.json files updated (homepage/repository fields, LoreDocs license fixed to BSL-1.1)
- Both .plugin zips rebuilt
Where tracked: `CLAUDE.md` Debbie TODO #3

#### Activate live Stripe account
- Sandbox already set up (2026-03-22). LoreDocs `tiers.py` has TierEnforcer ready.
- Credit union account still pending (technical issue as of 4/2)
- What's needed: business verification, bank account for payouts, EIN for Labyrinth Analytics
Where tracked: `CLAUDE.md` Debbie TODO #5

#### Publish Madison blog post #2 -- READY FOR REVIEW
- "Building a Reference Library for AI Projects: A Vault Blueprint for Reliable AI Development"
- File: `docs/internal/marketing/blog_drafts/blog_loredocs_vault_architecture_2026_04_03.md`
- Blog #1 published successfully on Apr 2
- **STATUS: All fixes applied 2026-04-07. Ready for Debbie review.**
- **FIXES APPLIED BY MADISON (2026-04-07):**
  1. Frontmatter format: `date` now quoted, `keywords` and `products` converted to multi-line YAML list format, `status: draft` field removed
  2. Version number: "LoreDocs v0.1.0" removed, replaced with "LoreDocs is production-ready for storing and organizing reference knowledge..."
  3. Competitor naming: Kept direct naming (Confluence/Notion/Google Drive) as defensible -- these are general tools, not direct AI competitors.
  4. Minor polish: AI Workflow narrated-session paragraph split into two shorter paragraphs for better pacing.
  Full review saved to LoreConvo (session 8f296a1e).

#### New blog post #3 -- DRAFT READY FOR REVIEW
- "Your AI's Knowledge Stack: Why LoreDocs, Obsidian, and NotebookLM Complement Each Other"
- File: `docs/internal/marketing/blog_drafts/blog_knowledge_stack_venn_2026_04_07.md`
- Created by Madison Apr 7. Positions LoreDocs alongside complementary tools (Obsidian, NotebookLM). Not competing, complementing.

### ON HOLD

#### File USPTO trademarks for LoreConvo & LoreDocs
- ON HOLD per Debbie 2026-04-02: wait until products gain traction (repo views, users, revenue)
- Class 009, estimated $350 each. Names are TESS-clean and Google-clean.
Where tracked: `CLAUDE.md` Debbie TODOs #1 and #2

## Ron Action Items (CURRENT)

### TOP PRIORITY for next Ron session

1. **Fix SEC-014:** Add `cryptography>=42.0.0` to [project.dependencies] in both
   `ron_skills/loreconvo/pyproject.toml` and `ron_skills/loredocs/pyproject.toml`.
   Without this, Pro license validation fails with ModuleNotFoundError on fresh installs.

2. **Clean stale git locks (first):** `find .git -name "*.lock" -mmin +30 -delete`
   Then commit untracked files:
   - `scripts/generate_license_key.py`
   - `scripts/test_generate_license_key.py`
   - `docs/internal/security/security_report_2026_04_03_b.md`

3. **LoreConvo CLI entry point (TODO #1):** Add `ron_skills/loreconvo/src/cli/` with
   save-session, list-sessions, search commands. Migrate logic from scripts/save_to_loreconvo.py.

4. **Fix GINA-001 (MEDIUM):** Fix `vault_set_tier` bypass in LoreDocs -- get_tier() reads config.json fallback before license check. Must be fixed before marketplace publish.

5. **Fix GINA-002 (MEDIUM):** Rebuild LoreConvo .plugin bundle to include the `/lore-onboard` skill. Users installing from marketplace won't get the onboarding command without this fix.

6. **Fix MEG-038 (LOW):** Remove unused import (Encoding, PublicFormat) in `ron_skills/loreconvo/src/core/license.py`.

### AFTER CLI ENTRY POINTS

5. LoreDocs CLI entry point (TODO #2)
6. Slim down agent prompts to reference product CLIs (TODO #3)
7. Update monorepo scripts to be thin wrappers (TODO #4)
8. Update CLAUDE.md agent paths (TODO #5, cleanup)

## Reviews Waiting (Agent Reports)

### Gina Architecture -- 2026-04-04 (RAN -- 3 proposals)
Architecture proposals for all 3 waiting items. Full proposals in `docs/internal/architecture/`.

**OPP-015 (Data Catalog Lite, P1):** HIGH COMPATIBILITY with Lore architecture. Reuses TierEnforcer pattern. $10/mo Pro. Gina recommends APPROVE.

**OPP-013 (Data Pipeline Test Harness, P2):** MODERATE COMPATIBILITY. New pattern (dual-DB connections). $15/mo Pro. Review carefully before approving.

**OPP-016 (ETL Pattern Library, P3):** Gina recommends scope RETHINK -- SQL-Server-only is too narrow. Reframe to two-dialect (T-SQL + Python) or pure Python. Needs your decision on scope before she can approve.

**Product review findings (2 MEDIUM):**
- **GINA-001 (MEDIUM):** LoreDocs `vault_set_tier('pro')` via MCP bypasses license validation. Ron must fix before publish.
- **GINA-002 (MEDIUM):** `/lore-onboard` skill not packaged in .plugin bundle. Ron must rebuild .plugin zip.

Full report: `docs/internal/architecture/product_review_2026_04_04.md`

### John Tech Docs -- 2026-04-04 (FIRST RUN)
